                  We believe the primary reason the church exists on earth is to
                  worship God by obeying the Lord Jesus Christ’s command to
                  proclaim the unchanging gospel of the kingdom of God
                  throughout the world, and to make disciples of all nations.
                  (Matthew 28:18-20)

                  We believe the Bible is God’s only written revelation. All of
                  Scripture, the Old and New Testaments, is fully inspired and
                  preserved by the Holy Spirit and is completely trustworthy.
                  The Bible is the supreme and final revelatory authority on all
                  matters of faith and practice for all times and in all
                  cultures. The Bible requires our unreserved submission and
                  obedience in all areas of life. (2 Timothy 3:16)

                  We believe in only one God, the sovereign Creator and Lord of
                  all things, infinitely perfect and eternally existing in three
                  persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We affirm that God is
                  the creator, sustainer, ruler, redeemer, and judge of the
                  world. We believe God deserves our complete worship and
                  obedience forever. (Hebrews 1:10-12)

                </h2>
                <p>
                  We believe that Jesus Christ is true God who became true man
                  united in one person. He became human through His miraculous
                  conception by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary. Jesus
                  Christ, being the only God-man, is the only Savior and
                  mediator between God and humanity. There is no other name by
                  which we can and must be saved. He died on the cross for the
                  salvation of humanity. He arose bodily from the dead on the
                  third day, and ascended into the presence of God Almighty. (1
                  Corinthians 15:3-5)

                <p>
                  We believe the Holy Spirit is God and equal with the Father
                  and Jesus Christ in being and nature. We believe in the Holy
                  Spirit’s immediate gracious presence and power through His
                  fruit, gifts, and ongoing empowerment. The ministry of Holy
                  Spirit leads us to repentance, unites us to God through the
                  new birth of regeneration, empowers our discipleship, ministry
                  and witness, and unifies the universal church as one body.

                  We believe that all people, male and female, are created in
                  the image of God and are eternally loved. However, because of
                  our total and intentional rebellion against God, all of
                  humanity became estranged from, and enemies of, God. If anyone
                  remains outside of Jesus Christ through persistent unbelief
                  they are eternally condemned. (John 3:16-19)

                  We believe salvation is completely dependent upon the work of
                  God’s free grace through the life, death and resurrection of
                  Jesus Christ, and not a product of human effort. God credits
                  His righteousness to everyone who puts their faith in Christ
                  alone for their salvation. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

                  We believe in the lifelong process of spiritual growth toward
                  the attainable goal of Christian maturity. Sanctification is
                  an ongoing process of yielding to God’s Word and His
                  empowering Holy Spirit so that Christians can live holy lives
                  pleasing to God, and effectively witness to the power of God’s
                  grace. (Romans 12:1-2)

                  We believe that the true universal church consists of all who,
                  through faith in Jesus Christ, are united by God together in
                  the one body of Christ. The universal church finds her
                  visible, yet imperfect, expression in local congregations
                  throughout the world. We value and respect all of God’s
                  people, past and present, and desire to partner with all true
                  churches around the world in biblical and functional unity.

                  can predict with any certainty the time of Christ’s coming. We
                  believe God will perfect His kingdom purposes at the end of
                  the world, and we look forward with confidence and eager
                  anticipation to that Day when God will establish His new
                  heaven and new earth in which righteousness and justice will
                  reign forever and ever. (Revelation 21:1-5)
