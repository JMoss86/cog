                Len and Sharon Griffin founded Covenant of Grace in March of
                1988 and have served as Lead Pastors here since then. Under
                their leadership, Covenant of Grace has served the Greater
                Phoenix area for decades in a variety of ways. The church has
                partnered with St Mary’s Food Bank to provide food and clothing
                to those in need. Recovery Ministries have served those
                struggling with life-controlling addictions. ESL Classes have
                helped countless refugees and immigrants assimilate into their
                new country. Covenant of Grace and its sister congregation,
                Pacto de Gracia, has grown to become an influential
                multi-cultural and multi-generational congregation in North
                Central Phoenix.
                <br />
                <br />
                Sharon was a pioneer in Refugee Ministry in the Greater Phoenix
                area and founded Global Transitions, our auxiliary Community
                Development Corporation which has served the immigrant community
                and other at risk communities in the area. She is a gifted
                teacher of God’s Word and has an apostolic and pastoral call on
                her life.
                <br />
                <br />
                In addition to his local church pastoral ministry, Len has been
                a leader in the City-Church Movement and Prayer Movement and has
                partnered with many other Pastors and Para-Church ministries to
                build and foster unity among churches and leaders throughout
                Arizona. He and Sharon are Founding Board members of Grace
                Association (a Relational Network of Churches). He also helped
                start and develop Pastors In Covenant, a small group network of
                Pastors who meet regularly for accountability and support. He
                has traveled and ministered internationally in Central and South
                America, Africa, South East Asia and the Caribbean. Len is also
                a worship leader, writer, hiker.
                <br />
                <br />
                Len and Sharon love to camp and fish. Sharon is an avid gardener
                and Len hunts as often as possible. They have one son, David, a
                granddaughter, Alexis, and a great-grandchild on the way. They
                also have two “adopted” sons, Washington from Liberia and
                Michael from Burma.

                My hope for the future, in both ministry and my personal life,
                is for all those around me, and especially the children under my
                care, to be blessed and to feel loved. To be excited to come to
                church and learn more about Jesus, to pursue righteousness as an
                expression of their love for God, to have true peace, and to
                walk intimately with their Savior as they get to know him
                better. I pray that I can both set an example for others to
                follow by living out these principles personally and speak Truth
                into the hearts of others as we all grow together; I pray we
                influence more and more people around us, so the message of
                Christ will spread with boldness and love.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the ministry, I hope each child experiences the tangible love
                of Christ each Sunday through the volunteers who minister to
                them, and that those volunteers are filled with blessing in so
                doing. I pray that parents feel that love too, and take comfort
                in the quality of care and love their child is receiving, so
                they can fully focus their heart on the service, be refreshed in
                their spirit, and grow in their walk with Christ, as we work as
                a whole church, I hope each member of every family takes home
                nuggets of God’struth and spurs each other on towards love and
                good deeds.
